Just a Basic 1 in 1 out Neural Net Playground nothing too fancy

## Stuff to Start working on 
- [ ] A way to load a Dataset so that we can build a NN by matching that function line to the neural net line
- [ ] A way to Import/Export Weights and Biases 
- [x] A selector to choose activation function
- [ ] Make the graph animate on X axis changes
- [ ] Improve the NN function's algo
- [ ] Fix when changing a before Layer Length, the neurons weights of next Layers are not Updated
- [ ] Fix Starfiled not showing
